#Our Final Project Idea: Exploding Camels - offers a unique twist on the popular card game "Exploding Kittens," but set in a desert landscape. Players will navigate this harsh environment, collect resources, and avoid the Exploding Camel cards. Drawing an Exploding Camel card means your camel is exploding due to thirst, and the only hope lies in the valuable water cards (defuse cards). This project brings a desert-themed card game to life, creating an engaging and distinctive card-playing experience.
