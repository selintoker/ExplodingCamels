  Our project Exploding Camels - a unique twist on the popular card game 
  "Exploding Kittens" - is a strategic card game about cats and destruction.
  The deck includes cards such as “Exploding Camel,” “Water,” “Shuffle,” 
  and “See the Future.” The main goal of the game is to avoid drawing the 
  “Exploding Camel” card using all the other card types. The player who draws 
  it is eliminated from the game.
